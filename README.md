Welcome to the "Responsive Design Project - Agency Website"! In this project, I enhanced the given HTML site to make it more responsive to different screen sizes. This was achieved through various CSS techniques, including the use of `<span>`, `@media` queries, and the `display` attribute to ensure that elements adapt gracefully to varying viewport dimensions.

## Project Overview

- **Title**: Responsive Design Project - Agency Website
- **Objective**: Improve website responsiveness by optimizing layout for different screen sizes.

### HTML Structure

The project starts with a basic HTML structure representing the main content of the agency website:

- **`<div class="main">`**: This container holds the logo, agency title, and two content cards.

- **`<div class="left card">` and `<div class="right card">`**: These divs contain content cards with images, titles, and descriptions.

### CSS Styling

- **Media Queries (`.css`)**: The project's CSS file, referenced with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">`, incorporates `@media` queries to apply different styles based on screen size. For example, elements stack vertically on smaller screens to improve readability and usability.

- **Font Loading**: Google Fonts are preloaded to ensure efficient font rendering, enhancing the website's overall performance.

- **Responsive Images**: Images are adjusted and scaled appropriately to fit various screen sizes, ensuring a visually pleasing experience across devices.

## Responsive Design Techniques

- **`<span>` Element**: The `<span>` element is utilized to selectively style a portion of text within the agency title for emphasis.

- **`@media` Queries**: Media queries are used to define different styles for various screen sizes. For instance, elements are set to stack vertically on smaller screens to maintain readability.

- **`display` Attribute**: The `display` attribute is modified to control the layout of elements, allowing for responsive design adjustments.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS files to see how responsiveness is achieved in this project. By making use of `<span>`, `@media` queries, and the `display` attribute, the website adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience for users on various devices.

Enjoy navigating the responsive agency website!
